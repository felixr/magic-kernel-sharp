'make' will make 'default': debug executables in build/dbg/bin.

To make optimized executables, use 'make all'; these will be in build/opt/bin.

'make test' will run unit tests in debug mode; use 'make otest' for optimized.

If you get errors in linking, note that a few standard libraries need to be
installed, which vary for different distros (google if you get stuck):

- For errors with -lz, you need to install something like zlib, zlib-dev, or
  zliblg-dev.
- For errors with -lpng, you need to install something like libpng or
  libpng-devel.
- For errors with -ljpeg, you need to install something like libjpeg or
  libjpeg-devel.
- You should not get errors with -lpthread on any distro.

For information about the "jpC" paradigm used in this code, see lib/jpc.h.

All code is in ANSI C (C89).
